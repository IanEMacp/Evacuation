# Strategies of Evacuation

CS-288

Instructor: Prof. Lee Spector

This is a project based on Alexandros Rigos, Erik Mohlin, Enrico Ronchi's paper, 'The cry wolf effect in evacuation: A game theoretic approach'

We did the simulation again with a more specific focus on game theory and some simple strategies.
